            <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <br>
        <p>This poject aimed at designing a GUI for a smartphone application for remote collaboration. Connectify is an application for short meetings between students,
             designed with a playful touch. Though its purpose is for shorter meetings, the application should not discourage its users who attend a meeting over an extended 
             period. The application lets users easily connect with each other and contains features such as the classic video meeting functions, homepage, break-out rooms,
            synchronous text messages, and video meeting customization. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Online collaboration has become an integral part of many professionals' work life today. 
            Collaborative tools, such as Zoom, facilitate much of the collaboration, and the trend towards remote work is expected to 
            continue to reduce travel and its climate impact. Nevertheless, some usage problems persist with a lot of these tools, and there is room 
            for envisioning even better collaborative tools for more effective online collaboration.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>Design Process</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The problem statement and requirements were given at the beginning of the project, so our work began with benchmarking
             various collaboration tools like Zoom, Teams, and Messenger. Next, we created wireframes and worked on the overall app design, 
             including the color scheme and logo.

                <h1>Video meeting functions</h1>
                <p>Connectify is a video and audio call application with standard features. Additional 
                    functions are available under More Options (represented by three dots) in the top left 
                    corner of the meeting room. Users can modify their name, video background, screen sharing, 
                    and other settings here. A Hang-Up icon in the top right corner lets users exit calls anytime.</p>

                <p>The homepage showcases the user's favorite groups at the screen's top, succeeded by an All Calls list. 
                    Initiating a new meeting is achieved via the New Video Meeting icon in the top right. Ongoing meetings are marked by a Green 
                    Video icon. Adding a group to Favorites is done by tapping the Star symbol, but it remains in the All Calls list. Scrolling reveals 
                    the 15 latest calls.</p>

                    Each break-out room has a Join button, allowing for quick and easy participation. When clicking on one specific break-out room, 
                    a list of all participants will appear, with the possibility to scroll down if the participants exceed the screen real estate. </p>

                    Messages can be sent to a specific person or to everyone in the meeting. A scroll view is located on the top of

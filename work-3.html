<!--------------------Background & Problem statement & Design Process---------------->

            <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The aim of this project was to design a resource booking website specifically for Chalmers University students and teachers. 
            Bookit streamlines the process of reserving rooms and equipment, while also providing a filter option to search for available resources 
            based on specific criteria such as time, date, and room or equipment type. Users can also conveniently book multiple rooms and equipment at once.
             Additionally, the website offers user-friendly features for easy creation, editing, and cancellation of bookings.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Balancing automatic booking and manual control during the booking process is crucial. The system should assist users in finding available 
            rooms and allow for quick booking, while also enabling manual adjustments to room selection. Proper controls and feedback are necessary for 
            effective interaction between automatic algorithms and user-controlled selection.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>Design Process</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The problem statement and requirements were given at the beginning of the project, so my work began with benchmarking. 
            I took inspiration from other booking resources such as TimeEdit and Airbnb, and created some wireframes. During the website design process, 
            I also asked friends and family to try the prototype and give feedback on the overall design.

                <h1>Home Page</h1>
                <p>The website's home page will offer direct access to search and filter functionality, enabling users to easily find available 
                    resources that meet their specific needs even without logging in. However, to make new bookings and access current bookings, users 
                    must log in to the website.</p>

                <h1>My Bookings</h1>
                <p>On the "My Bookings" page, users can view their active bookings. They can toggle between week and day view in the calendar 
                    to get the desired overview. The page displays important information about the booking, including the date, location, time, 
                    status, and whether it is a shared or personal booking. Users can also easily edit or delete bookings.</p>

                <h1>Undo</h1>
                <p>When you delete a booking, a pop-up window will appear, remaining visible for 10 seconds. 
                    Within this timeframe, you have the option to undo the action, and the booking will be restored. 
                    Alternatively, you can simply close the pop-up directly without affecting the booking. 
                    This feature ensures a user-friendly experience, providing a safety net in case of accidental deletions.</p>

                <h1>Booking A Room</h1>
                <p>You can easily search for a booking by location, date, and equipment. 
                    Unavailable time slots are displayed in grey, making it clear when a room is not free.
                     Hovering over a slot in the calendar changes its color and provides additional details 
                     about the date and time. When you select a slot, the calendar automatically switches to the booking window for a seamless user experience. </p>

                <h1>Filter Option</h1>
                <p>A filter option allows users to fine-tune their requirements. The filtered results are presented as various booking options that 
                    can be directly reserved. The feature also suggests different room combinations to provide more flexibility in selecting the most 
                    suitable booking arrangement.</p>

                    If a repeat pattern is selected, and one of the dates is unavailable, the system will provide alternative suggestions 
                    for available bookings. Alternatively, users can edit the booking manually. This feature enhances convenience and flexibility 
                    in managing recurring reservations.</p>

                <p>Once the booking is confirmed, users have the option to share it with their classmates, teachers, or TAs. When the booking is shared, 
                    the recipient receives a notification containing details about the date, time, and location. The recipient can choose to ignore the 
                    invitation by selecting "cancel" or add the booking to their own "My bookings" section, which will then be displayed in their calendar 
                    for easy reference. This feature facilitates seamless collaboration and ensures everyone involved stays informed about the scheduled events.</p>

            <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <br>
        <p>This project's primary focus is to analyze usability issues in Apple's mobile app Podcaster and develop an enhanced 
            interface following the ISO-definition of usability and Jordan's usability aspects. The ultimate goal is to enhance user 
            experience and optimize user interactions with the app.
            <br><br>

           This project marked my first experience in designing for usability and creating a digital product. It was during this 
           project that I discovered my passion for interaction design.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Although Podcaster offers a wide range of features, numerous negative comments can be found among the app reviews in Apple's App Store. 
            Users often mention difficulties in navigating between different pages and express their perception of the app as cluttered and poorly 
            thought out. These comments indicate a clear potential for improving the app's usability. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>Design Process</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The project began with conducting theoretical studies, including Hierarchical Task Analysis, Cognitive Walkthrough, and Predictive Human Error Analysis, 
            to explore the existing product's design. Moreover, empirical studies like user tests were also performed. Utilizing the insights from these analyses and 
            drawing upon Jordan's and Norman's design guidelines, we created a redesigned version of the application using Adobe XD. The iterative process allowed for 
            continuous improvement, and the redesigned app was evaluated using the same methods as the original application. We wanted to keep the overall design language 
            of the app as it is and focused on making smaller changes in the redesign.

                <h1>Search </h1>
                <p>One issue that was documented on the page  "Search" was that the complete search result wasn't visible to the user. 
                    To address this, the size of the program images was reduced, and a row of images was removed. This created space for the results, 
                    thus improving the page's overall layout.</p>

                <h1>Meatball Menus</h1>
                <p>The meatball menus, which used to appear as small pop-ups upon user interaction, were redesigned into entirely new pages. 
                    This decision was primarily driven by the limited visual clarity of the small pop-ups, contributing to a cluttered user 
                    experience. Furthermore, the choice was influenced by the app's consistency in presenting other functions, such as the settings 
                    page, "View all" lists, and profile page, as new windows upon selection. Hence, this change was considered justified for all 
                    meatball menus throughout the app.

                <h1>Follow button</h1>
                <p>On the program page, the original app had two ways to start following the podcast. To avoid redundancy, 
                    the appearance of the previous plus button was modified, and the symbol was replaced with the text "Follow." 
                    When the user selects the button, the text changes to "Following" to provide feedback on the action.</p>

                <h1>Timer Function</h1>
                <p>The issues observed with starting the timer were related to not finding the function since the user had to scroll down to do so. 
                    We wanted to keep the function within the player, as it is linked to episode playback. 
                    However, we wanted to make sure users can find it. Given that other player functions were 
                    accessible via icons, we designed the queue and timer in a similar manner. </p>

                <h1>Que Function</h1>
                <p>The queue feature was primarily tested, and uncertainty regarding the distinction between "Play next" and "Play latest" was noted. 
                    As a result, these two functions were combined into one with the wording "Add to queue." This function corresponds to the previous 
                    "Play latest," where the selected episode is placed at the end of the queue. The app's compatibility has been enhanced, aligning with 
                    how queue functions work in other music or podcast apps.</p>

                <h1>Rephrase Labels</h1>
                <p>In the "Library" section, issues with the clarity of labels were identified in the first empirical assessment. 
                    To address this, "Programs," "Saved," "Downloaded," and "Latest episodes" were rephrased as "Followed programs," 
                    "Saved episodes," "Downloaded episodes," and "New episodes". These changes aimed to enhance user understanding. 
                    The label "Latest episodes" was already clear, but it was also rephrased to avoid confusion with "Recently played" in the 
                    "Listen Now" section.</p>
